  Link to: library.e-aaa.info (только для студентов)

\*Church Ministries Institute header:
• Capitalize C M and I in Church Ministries Institute header
• change (C M I) to font Phenomena Extra Bold
• change (hurch inistries nstitute) to font Phenomena Regular

\*Add below Church Ministries Header:
Founded in 1994 (keep font Seguo UI or change to Phenomena Regular or Phenomena Light?)

\*Keep all text font Seguo UI on all the pages/tabs (or Phenomena Regular or Phenomena Light) Font Phenomena is what has been used on our CMI flyers

\*Can we do blue background at the top with white lettering of Church Ministries Institute header?
Yellow border instead of blue border (switch colors to match flyers?)

\*We could put the flag to the far right of the list of tabs if it doesn’t show up well with a blue background…

Reaching beyond Ukrainian borders

\*Have a link to each underlined phrase on the Home page: Bible Schools, Online Courses, Ministry Seminars that will take them to the Programs tab/page if they click on it

\*Prospective Students: Dima: save the text and links you have created, but maybe under Velodya’s intro and the requirements only list the following updated text (hide/remove Undergraduate Program, Free Listener, and Accomodations—I think those are for KTS students, but don’t permanently delete on your computer in case they want to add it back in):

Bible Schools
Please contact our office to see if there is a local Bible school located near you!

Online Courses
Bible and theology classes are available to students in Europe and worldwide (Available languages: English and Russian)

*Make a link on underlined “contact our office” text under Bible Schools that sends them to the Contact tab
*Keep Online Courses Fill out the Form link under Prospective Students tab

*Programs tab: remove Jr. Bachelor for now (but save text)
*Remove numbers next to programs
*Change Church Based Bible School to Bible Schools
*Keep all text under Bible Schools but change to say “further education at Kyiv Theological Seminary” instead of “further education at our institute” unless we do mean they can receive further education through CMI
*Change Online Training (under Programs tab) to Online Courses and keep all the text under it
*Remove TNT info (under Programs tab) for now but save text…I was conferring with Mike about this today and we need to figure out in what section to include this. It’s kind of under Ministry Seminar but is a lot more comprehensive than just a seminar

~We also need to add any voluntary fees info. and the Doctrinal Statement that we reference in the Online Training Fill out this Form section. Do we have that info? Do I need to track down this info for you?
~I will add History information in the near future, ideally before I leave for Malta this Saturday 10/13
~In addition, in the future, maybe we can add the Facebook videos of Sasha and Velodya (subtitled for the English page)…I’m not sure what they are saying but I’m guessing they may be relevant and videos are always great!!
