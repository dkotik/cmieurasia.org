## Dima's Pitch
Dima joined the board of directors of the Church Ministries Institute (CMI) earlier this year. CMI provides Christian theological education through local churches by sending instructors to regional training centers in Ukraine and abroad.

Local churches cover the cost of the on-sight expenses and take good care of the instructors, which makes it possible for the institute to have more students and wider reach than any of the seminaries in Eurasia. On top of that, the students have the option to transfer earned credits to count towards an accredited degree.

CMI is locally staffed and has operated for 25 years. CMI helped many churches equip both lay and ordained ministers. Case in point: our church plant in Ukraine is led by a CMI graduate. Last week Dima taught _Church History_ at one of the regional centers (photo attached).

CMI is moving to a new facility, which requires furnishings. Its **electronic equipment** has not been upgraded for over 10 years.
