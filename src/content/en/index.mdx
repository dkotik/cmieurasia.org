The Church Ministries Institute has been preparing Christians for local church ministry since 1994 by providing quality theological education and ministry seminars. We are members of the Euro-Asian Accreditation Association (EAAA). Training takes place in local churches, our regional education centers, our international center (Kyiv, Ukraine), and online. Having received a quality education and practical ministry skills, our graduates are effectively serving in local churches across Eurasia.
