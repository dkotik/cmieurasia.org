### Bible Schools

- Located in local churches throughout Ukraine
- Available Programs: Certificate Program

Bible schools typically meet on a Saturday (8 hours) and Sunday (2 hours) two different weekends when our CMI teacher travels to their church to teach a course.

Bible schools give students a unique chance to learn to study God’s Word in a systematic fashion in their home church without distancing themselves from their families and jobs. If a Bible school is not located nearby, students may study at our regional education centers (located in Ukraine and Armenia), our international center (Kyiv, Ukraine), or online.

**Upon completion of the Certificate Program courses, students will receive the Church Ministries Institute certificate.**
