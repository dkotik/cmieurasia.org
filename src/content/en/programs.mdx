  No theological training center can replace the local church. By God's grace we merely help to edify and develop Christian community. We believe that the Lord put our institute in a strategic place for partnership with Kyiv Theological Seminary (KTS) and local churches in order to meet the acute need of preparing workers for evangelical churches.
