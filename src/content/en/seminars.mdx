# Ministry Seminars

**Offered in local churches, our regional education centers, and our international center.**

## Good Soil (Evangelism and Discipleship)

- One day condensed training seminar, offered upon request
- Two day expanded training seminar, offered upon request

Using materials developed by the [Association of Baptists for World Evangelism (ABWE)](https://www.abwe.org/), the [Good Soil](https://www.goodsoil.com/) seminar equips believers to “share God’s story of redemption chronologically, so that people will clearly understand, sincerely embrace, and firmly hold onto the gospel.” This seminar also serves as an introduction to the CMI for those local churches interested in potentially becoming Bible schools.

## Storyline (Introduction to Missions)

- One day training seminar, offered upon request

Using materials developed by [Storyline Missions](https://www.storylinemissions.org/), the Storyline seminar is designed to help believers “discover God’s purpose, God’s people, and God’s plan for global missions, introducing important Biblical, historical, cultural, and strategic realities for elevating one’s understanding of the Great Commission.”

## Training for National Trainers (Expositional Preaching)

- Three day training seminar, offered twice a year

In partnership with [Leadership Resources](https://www.leadershipresources.org/), the Training for National Trainers (TNT) seminar is focused on equipping pastors and church leaders (following the model of 2 Timothy 2:2) to in turn equip their own church leaders to teach and preach expositionally through the Bible. After exploring the meaning of a particular text or passage of Scripture in its original context, the goal is to preach for the strengthening and encouragement of the church.

**Additional seminars and workshops are available throughout the course of the year, designed to strengthen the local church.**
